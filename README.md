 Week 5 Python Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming (PLP)
This repository contains my **Week 5 Python assignment** for the **Power Learn Project (PLP)**.
The focus of this assignment was to practice and demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python such as:

* Classes and Objects
* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
The project includes several Python programs that illustrate key OOP ideas:
1. House Class Example 
   Demonstrates constructors, encapsulation, and inheritance (with a `Mansion` subclass).

2. Vehicle Polymorphism Example 
   Shows how different vehicle classes implement the same `move()` method in unique ways.

3. Additional OOP Practice
   Includes other examples and comments explaining each concept clearly.
Technologies Used
 Python 3.x
 Visual Studio Code / XAMPP (for testing environment)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plp-week5-oop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd plp-week5-oop
   ```
3. Run any of the Python files:

   ```bash
   python house.py
   python vehicles.py
   ```

Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, I learned how to:

Define and use Python classes and objects.
Apply inheritance to extend base classes.
Implement encapsulation and data hiding.
Use polymorphism to create flexible, reusable code.
